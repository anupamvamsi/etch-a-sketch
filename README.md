## [Project 4 (TheOdinProject)](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)

This project aims to test the DOM (document object model) manipulation skills learnt so far during the course. It was something fun to make, because it also had the advantage of being able to fiddle around and know exactly what should go right, and especially for me since I am very used to working with drawing software. There were quite a few bugs which were difficult for me to figure out, but experimenting with the JavaScript code helped quite a lot in finally squashing those bugs.

### What's to like
- My implementation is kinda themed around the cyan-like color that I chose (which was also a dominant color in the previous [rock paper scissors](https://anupamvamsi.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/) I happened to make. 
- It also strays from the hover-color implementation that the course suggested we implement, and rather works like how you would maybe paint in MS Paint. 
- I particularly like the buttons and I had fun making them, even if they don't stand out a lot currently. 
- There is a key-press activation of the tools as well, like pressing `B` to activate the brush, or `E` for the eraser. 
- The reset button intentionally does not have a keyboard shortcut assigned and manually requires the user to click it because I'm painfully experienced with the times when you accidentally hit some keys and your work is gone.  (I know, you still can hit the reset button with your mouse or touchpad, but still.)

### What's not to like
- I don't actually prefer the buttons even though I claimed to like making them, since I'd prefer to design my own icons for the buttons (which I might do so in the future).
- The UI is pretty simple, nothing too appealing is what I feel, other than the color theme that's going on. I could probably put in more effort in making it more visually appealing.
- Majorly, it fails to work on mobile devices or devices where you want to use touch to etch a sketch (hehe) and you can only at most keep tapping to draw (I attempted to add touch but it didn't really work, I have to spend more time on it). Otherwise, you could say it works! Which you wouldn't. I wouldn't, either. 
- Coming to accessibility, I do not know if it is very accessible right now, it probably is not.
